## Design Process


## Features
Before entering the home page, there will be a loading screen displaying a lottie, after 10 seconds, it will redirect the user to the home page.
The home page will consist of a navigation bar with lotties at the top which will be collapsible when the screen becomes smaller. In the middle of the home page, there will be the search bar 
with the display of the country that the user wants to search for. The background is unique to each country searched and it it is with relevance to the country. It will either be a popular landmark or place.
The weather website will also allow the user to search for specific areas in the different countries to determine the weather there. This will be helpful to the user as not all countries are small like Singapore hence, it will 
be helpful to know the weather in different locations.
